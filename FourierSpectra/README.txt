In plotF.m, change file name and path to some suitable files. On line7, the number x in data(x,:) corresponds to electrode.

For comparison, for example, use Dog_4_preictal_segment_0xxx.mat and Dog_4_interictal_segment_0xxx.mat
The file numbers need not match, pick any random file. However, while comparing, the electrode numbers must be same.
